Virtual Environment

Any changes made in the packages in main system will not be reflected in the versions of the packages present in the virtual environment.

Commands for setting up virtual environment:
1. Install the module:
	pip install virtualenv
2. Create the virtual environment which will be fresh env without any pre-installed packages:
	virtualenv sachin
3. activate the virtualenv:
	./sachin/Scritps/activate
4. If the command in 3rd points gives error, then set the executionpolicy remotesigned as yes:
	set-executionpolicy remotesigned and then enter y

5. Again run the command at point 3 to activate and enter in the virtual env.
6. Here we have the python installed which is fresh and independent of the python present outside of our virtual environment.

7. We can get the list of all the packages installed in our virtual environment:
	pip freeze > requirements.txt
8. If we want to install all the packages with same version as given in requirements.txt:
	pip install -r ./requirements.txt
	
9. If we need that our virtualenv has all the packages as in our main system:
	virtualenv --system-site-packages sachin2
